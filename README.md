# ðŸ§¬ Volcano Plot Shiny App

This is a Shiny web application to generate customizable **volcano plots** from bulk RNA-seq differential gene expression (DEG) data.  
It helps researchers quickly visualize significant gene expression changes and export publication-ready plots.

## ðŸ“¦ Features

- Upload your DEG analysis results as a CSV file.
- Customize significance thresholds (`p-value` and `log2FoldChange`).
- Add your own plot title.
- Choose from multiple ggplot2 themes.
- Adjust plot size (width & height).
- Export plots to various formats (PNG, JPG, PDF, EPS, TIFF, BMP, SVG).

## ðŸ“Š Plot details

The app creates volcano plots by:
- Coloring points based on significance:
  - **Upregulated** genes (`log2FoldChange` â‰¥ threshold and adjusted `p-value` < threshold) in red.
  - **Downregulated** genes (`log2FoldChange` â‰¤ -threshold and adjusted `p-value` < threshold) in blue.
  - **Not significant** genes in grey.
- Using `-log10(padj)` for the y-axis and `log2FoldChange` for the x-axis.

## ðŸ“‚ Input requirements

Your CSV file must include **these columns** (case-sensitive):
- `Gene` : Gene identifiers or symbols.
- `padj` : Adjusted p-values.
- `log2FoldChange` : Log2 fold changes vs control.

Example format:
```csv
Gene,padj,log2FoldChange
GeneA,0.001,3.5
GeneB,0.05,-2.1
